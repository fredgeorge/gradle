Starting point for developing Kotlin projects

## Instructions

Kotlin is relatively easy to setup with IntelliJ IDEA. 
Gradle is used for building and testing the project, and is a 
prerequisite. Install if necessary.
The following instructions are for installing the code 
in IntelliJ 2021 by JetBrains. 
Adapt as necessary for your environment.

This implementation uses:

- IntelliJ 2021.2
- Kotlin 1.5.21
- Java SDK 16.0.2 
- Gradle 7.1.1
- JUnit 5-style for testing.

Open the code:

- Download the source code from github.com/fredgeorge/gradle
    - Clone, or pull and extract the zip
- Open IntelliJ
- Choose "Open" (it's a Gradle project)
- Navigate to the reference code root, and enter

After loading into IntelliJ, adjust

- settings.gradle.kts with project name
- directory structure per client requirements

Source and test directories should already be tagged as such,
with test directories in green.

Confirm that everything builds correctly (and necessary libraries exist).
